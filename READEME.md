#Pretty Notes

This was for trying to complete a challenge of creating a Notes app under 24 hours.
But, lost it after understanding that Java with outside Java World is too much difficult to deal with.
And it took me almost 8 hours to finish up everything except Database Connection. And on the 3rd day I connected the SQL-Lite database with my Notes Application.
